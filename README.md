**#Hotel Room Booking System ( Java Project )**

**INTRODUCTION**

In today’s fast-moving hospitality industry, hotel management needs quick and accurate ways to handle room reservations. Manual record-keeping often causes errors like double bookings, mismanagement of room availability, and difficulty calculating total revenue.
The Hotel Room Booking System is a computerized Java Swing application designed to automate and simplify hotel operations. The system allows customers to book, cancel, and view available rooms through a user-friendly graphical interface.
Hotel staff or receptionists can also search for customer bookings, track total revenue, and ensure efficient room utilization.
This system helps hotels reduce paperwork, speed up booking operations, and provide better customer service.

**REAL-WORLD PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**

Hotels and lodges often rely on manual methods (paper or spreadsheets) to record customer bookings, which can lead to:

•
Booking conflicts and double reservations.

•
Human errors in calculating total payments.

•
Difficulty in checking room availability in real time.
